Developing a Single Page App with Flask and Vue.js

The following is a step-by-step walkthrough of how to set up a basic CRUD app with Vue and Flask. We'll start by scaffolding a new Vue application and then move on to performing the basic CRUD operations through a back-end RESTful API powered by Python and Flask.

python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

-------------------
Add an app.py file to the newly created "server" directory:

from flask import Flask, jsonify
from flask_cors import CORS

# instantiate the app
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_object(__name__)

# enable CORS
CORS(app, resources={r'/*': {'origins': '*'}})

# sanity check route
@app.route('/ping', methods=['GET'])
def ping_pong():
    return jsonify('pong!')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
-------------------

(env)$ flask run --port=5001 --debug

quit that.
